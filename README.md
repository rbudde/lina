This is a repository setup to show how git works, how github works and contains small example written by young students who want to learn programming, mainly using eclipse and java. Documentation is often in german. 

I think, that this repository is not of public interest :-)

Things you need on your computer:

* Java 8
* Maven >= 3.2
* Git
